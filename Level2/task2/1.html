            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Kalpana Chawla was an Indian-born American astronaut and the first woman of Indian origin to go to
                space. Born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, she always dreamed of flying and touching the skies.
                She completed her Bachelor’s in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College and later moved
                to the United States to pursue her Master’s and Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering. Kalpana joined NASA in
                1995 and flew her first mission in 1997 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, becoming an inspiration for
                millions.
                <br><br>
                Her second space mission was in 2003, again aboard Columbia, which unfortunately disintegrated during
                re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, taking her life and that of six other crew members. Despite her tragic
                end, Kalpana Chawla’s legacy lives on — she is remembered as a symbol of perseverance, courage, and
                limitless ambition. She broke barriers and proved that with determination and dedication, even the sky
                is not the limit.
